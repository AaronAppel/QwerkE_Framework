# QwerkE_Framework
*This project is a work in progess and is continually in an unstable state*  
Qwerk Engine is a simple framework that developers can use to build games.

There are simple systems like rendering, audio, input, etc, that can be utilized or replaced with custom systems as you wish.
The whole framework is built to be modular and allow as much customization as possible, while maintaining a structure you can utilize.

Look for examples and documentation to see intended implementation examples as well as custom system overrides.

QwerkE is currently only built for windows 32bit. Hopefully it can expand to as many platforms as possible.

### Note
There is also a runtime application that has engine features such as scene editing, scripting, debugging, nice GUIs, and more!
That project lives here: www.github.com/AaronAppel/Qwerk_Engine
