// INTRO:
    // Qwerk Engine is a project I am developing to expand my knowledge and skills as a programmer.
    // I aim to learn more about game engine architecture and technology in hopes of creating an
    // engine or framework for future projects.

    // QwerkE is also meant to be a "living" portfolio piece that I will be expanding on to show
    // potential employers, as well as friends and family.


// SETUP:
    // Unfortunately you may need to add an additional include directory for some because
    // of how their files look for each other using set include paths.

	// Additional includes...
	// freetype2, bullet3, OpenAL, and more...

    // Other than that you should only need to #include QwerkE.h and make sure the file structure
    // is kept the same as how it is distributed from https://github.com/AaronAppel/QwerkE.
	// Ensure you are using the proper libraries and other files when developing for x86 vs x64.

// USAGE:
    // #include "QwerkE_Include.h"
    // WIP

// EXAMPLES:
    // WIP

// DOCUMENTATION:
    // WIP

// API:
    // WIP

// START:
#include "Source/Headers/QwerkE_Include.h"
